# fancytree_issue

Finally, made the electron webapp working with version fancytree v2.24.0, with a weird twist.  
To make it run, here is the procedure:

> npm run install_all

> npm run myapp

However, I was not able to make it work with standard npm install jquery.fancytree package installed in node_modules
